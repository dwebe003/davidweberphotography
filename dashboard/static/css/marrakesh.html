<div class="print-box-title"> A Friendly Haggle Between Two Merchants </div>

<div class="print-box-desc"> After a long trek through the Atlas Mountains, I wanted nothing more than to take a nap at my Marrakesh hostel. Fortunately the exciting allure of Jemaa El-Fna square quickly dismissed my fatigue. The aroma of countless orange juice shops, the melodic wailing of cobra charmers, and the vibrant dancers within any line of sight combine to give you this wonderfully euphoric feeling that you're on a different planet. It is here I caught a water merchant playfully buying tissues from a Berber woman.
